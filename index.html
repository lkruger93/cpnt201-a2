        <h2>Show Jumping</h2>
          <h3>Wikipedia 2020</h3>
           <p>Show jumping, also known as "stadium jumping", is a part of a group of English riding equestrian events that also
         includes dressage, eventing, hunters, and equitation. Jumping classes are commonly seen at horse shows throughout the
         world, including the Olympics. Sometimes shows are limited exclusively to jumpers, sometimes jumper classes are offered
         in conjunction with other English-style events, and sometimes show jumping is but one division of very large, all-breed
          competitions that include a very wide variety of disciplines.</p>

        <h2>Horse Behaviour</h2>
          <h3>Wikipedia 2020</h3>
            <p>Horse behavior is best understood from the view that horses are prey animals with a well-developed fight-or-flight
        response. Their first reaction to a threat is often to flee, although sometimes they stand their ground and defend
        themselves or their offspring in cases where flight is untenable, such as when a foal would be threatened.</p>

      <h2>Foal</h2>
        <h3>Wikipedia 2020</h3>
          <p>A foal is an equine up to one year old; this term is used mainly for horses. More specific terms are colt for a male
      foal and filly for a female foal, and are used until the horse is three or four. When the foal is nursing from its great
      (mother), it may also be called a "suckling". After it has been weaned from its dam, it may be called a "weanling". When
      a mare is pregnant, she is said to be "in foal". When the mare gives birth, she is "foaling", and the impending birth is
      usually stated as "to foal". A newborn horse is "foaled".</p>

        <h2>Driving</h2>
          <h3>Wikipedia 2020</h3>
            <p>Driving, when applied to horses, ponies, mules, or donkeys, is a broad term for hitching equines to a wagon, carriage,
        cart, sleigh, or other horse-drawn vehicle by means of a harness and working them in this way. It encompasses a wide
        range of activities from pleasure driving, to harness racing, to farm work, horse shows, and even international combined
        driving.</p>

        <h2>Horse</h2>
          <h3>Wikipedia 2020</h3>
            <p>The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal
        belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small
        multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around
        4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are
        domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses.</p>
